# Python-Projects
programs based on python (will update by every month)

In the program named "Compound_interest", it's mentioned that CI = principle * (pow((1 + rate / 100), time)).
I just want to add a suggestion that this can also be written as CI = principle * ((1 + rate)/100) ** time instead of using pow method.
Hope it helpspyt you!
